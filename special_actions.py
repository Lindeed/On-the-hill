"""Special actions are events that can be triggered directly by the player, as opposed to being spawned randomly
or semi-randomly. Internally, they work by having an 'event' slot, which finally ends up in game state's event queue.
For this reason, it should preferably contain an instance of BasicEvent, although obviously it can be anything that
has the same interface (minus the should_be_activated() and should_be_deactivated() function as the event never ends
up in the active or inactive deck."""
