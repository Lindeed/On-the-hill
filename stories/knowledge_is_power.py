knowledge, they'll just believe in everything you say.

forget about you. A messenger runs up to you and starts talking about
Geber Selgorn needing to see you in his office. Reluctantly, you stop

start going to school. Apparently, there's something unusual about
her. She's pale and weak and dehydrated but that's not what's important,
that's just minor food poisoning. The really interesting thing is that
unlike everyone else born in the last couple of decades she's never been
ill before - as if she didn't inherit the white plague. This would be
the first time someone like that was born here.

Selgorn admits that he took the liberty of sending a messenger to
the University. The road there is long and their bureaucratic procedures
are slow (everything there requires so many written documents, as if
talking to people was not enough for them; how can they even get
anything done?) but in a few months they'll probably send someone to
