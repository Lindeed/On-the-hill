"""This module contains classes for the in-game buildings. A building interface consists of:
        name, description - pretty self-explanatory
        price - amount of money required to build it; affected by terrain and potentially random events
        on_build(state), on_destroy(state), on_next_turn(state) - effects the building has on game's state
        can_be_built(map_tile, neighbors) - a predicate used for restricting the possibility of creating buildings
                                            in certain locations"""
